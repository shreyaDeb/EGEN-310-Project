## Teammates: Shreya Deb(myself), Kelby Abel, Melmer Isabelle, Boucher-Bergstedt Caelen, Windhorst Jacob

### This is our final project code for the Class EGEN 310, Collaborated with @kelby-Abel another computer Science student in my group.

Our aim for this project:

 1. To be able to control the rover designed by our co teammates (Boucher-Bergstedt Caelen, Windhorst Jacob)
 2. To be able to climb the ramp which is filled with water (which is controlled by a water motor to see the water level stop)
